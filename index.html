          <h2>Welcome to my blog</h2>
          <p>On this site, you will find demos of various things I have released
             on GitHub. I’ll try and dump as much stuff here as I can, but life’s
             a busy thing you know. Also, to be fair, most of the code I produce
             these days belongs to my employer - so can’t share any of that (see
             my LinkedIn profile for information about my professional projects).
             Nevertheless, over time you will see a pretty eclectic mix of random
             projects parked here.</p>
          <p>Enjoy!</p>

          <h2>Words of our Culture</h2>
          <p>This project is a linguistic analysis of the utterances within all
             the great English language movies, from the birth of sound cinema
             to the present day.</p>
          <p>The main output of this project is a visual model of the words
             which most characterise a given movie and, correspondingly, the
             movies which most align with a given word.</p>

          <h2>iPhone Controller</h2>
          <p>I've written some software which can remotely (and wirelessly)
             connect to an iPhone and analyse its screen in real time. Lots of
             cool stuff in there like AirPlay, Tesseract, XPath, Regex, Lexical
             Analyser, Amazon Polly, etc.</p>
          <p>By way of an example, I've created something which can play along
             to the popular mobile trivia game QuizUp. You can see a
             demonstration in the video linked below.</p>
          <p>I will check-in all the source code in GitHub in the coming weeks.
             It's a bit nascent right now and needs some organisation and tidy
             up first.</p>

          <h2>A Bubbles Visualisation in p5.js</h2>
          <p>A bubbles visualization for p5js. A fun way to represent quantitative
             data as a set of bubbles which grow, move and collide on the screen.
             The underlying mechanism is in a seperate script which is easily
             reusable by others working in p5js. You will find details of how to
             use it in the GitHub readme. Also there, I have written up an
             explanation of some of the maths and physics that underlies the
             visualization.</p>

          <h2>jQuery SlideIn</h2>
          <p>A slide-in panel for jQueryUI that works from all four sides. The
             panel overlays your main page and can be slid in on a mouse-click
             or mouse-hover. There are lots of other options for customisation
             such as a grab handle, slide speed, opacity, peeking-in etc. The
             plugin is excellent for housing user options which are only for
             occasional use, especially overlaid onto whole screen UIs that
             demand the entire screen real estate.</p>

          <h2>LocateTV</h2>
          <p>LocateTV was a great website which helped people find their
             favourite movies and shows on TV, online and on DVD. I lead the
             development team for the site and we took it from idea to launch in
             nine months.</p>
          <p>It ran for many years and eventually was clocking-up more than four
             million unique visitors a month. We had every English language movie
             and TV show ever made - with great data quality. We also had indexed
             every TV station in the USA and UK, as well as all the major online
             video portals.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the site was closed down as it was deemed non-strategic.
             You can still see videos of how it worked at the YouTube link below.
             Pay special attention to the video which shows how we were out-gunning
             all the major networks for SEO on their own shows!</p>
          <p>A white-labelled version of the site is still up and running as the
              main listings service for Time Warner Cable.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Echo : Boiler Plate Skill</h2>
          <p>A simple to use, boilerplate template for a new Alexa skill for the
             Amazon Echo. It’s not really useful in its literal form, as it’s
             real purpose is to show people how easy creating a custom skill can
             be. It basically allows your Echo to respond to utterances like
             “How does a duck go?” and Echo responds “Quack, Quack”. It does
             this for a range of animals. It also responds to “Roll a Dice”.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Echo : Sky Plus Skill</h2>
          <p>A connection between Amazon Echo and Sky Plus in the UK. Using this
             project you can create a new Alexa skill which can respond to a range
             of requests to control you SkyPlus box. It does this by posting key
             sequences directly to the box from the AWS cloud.</p>
          <p>Here are the types of utterances this code can recognise and respond
             to. In each case, the response comes after the channel change.
             Many more combinations than this are possible using this code.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>"Show me wildlife programs"</em> &raquo; This is Tiger Trail on the Discovery Channel. It started 12 minutes ago.</li>
            <li><em>"Put on a game show"</em> &raquo; You’re watching Family Fortunes on Challenge. It’s been on for 22 minutes.</li>
            <li><em>"Switch over to BBC 1"</em> &raquo; Now tuned to EastEnders on BBC 1. It kicked off 14 minutes ago.</li>
