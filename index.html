          <h2>Welcome to my blog</h2>
          <p>On this site, you will find demos of various things I have released
             on GitHub. I’ll try and dump as much stuff here as I can, but life’s
             a busy thing you know. Also, to be fair, most of the code I produce
             these days belongs to my employer - so can’t share any of that (see
             my LinkedIn profile for information about my professional projects).
             Nevertheless, over time you will see a pretty eclectic mix of random
             projects parked here.</p>
          <p>Enjoy!</p>

          <h2>A Bubbles Visualisation in p5.js</h2>
          <p>A bubbles visualization for p5js. A fun way to represent quantitative
             data as a set of bubbles which grow, move and collide on the screen.</p>

          <h2>jQuery SlideIn</h2>
          <p>A slide-in panel for jQueryUI that works from all four sides. The
             panel overlays your main page and can be slid in on a mouse-click
             or mouse-hover. There are lots of other options for customisation
             such as a grab handle, slide speed, opacity, peeking-in etc. The
             plugin is excellent for housing user options which are only for
             occasional use, especially overlaid onto whole screen UIs that
             demand the entire screen real estate.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Echo : Boiler Plate Skill</h2>
          <p>A simple to use, boilerplate template for a new Alexa skill for the
             Amazon Echo. It’s not really useful in its literal form, as it’s
             real purpose is to show people how easy creating a custom skill can
             be. It basically allows your Echo to respond to utterances like
             “How does a duck go?” and Echo responds “Quack, Quack”. It does
             this for a range of animals. It also responds to “Roll a Dice”.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Echo : Sky Plus Skill</h2>
          <p>A connection between Amazon Echo and Sky Plus in the UK. Using this
             project you can create a new Alexa skill which can respond to a range
             of requests to control you SkyPlus box. It does this by posting key
             sequences directly to the box from the AWS cloud.</p>
          <p>Here are the types of utterances this code can recognise and respond
             to. In each case, the response comes after the channel change.
             Many more combinations than this are possible using this code.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>"Show me wildlife programs"</em> &raquo; This is Tiger Trail on the Discovery Channel. It started 12 minutes ago.</li>
            <li><em>"Put on a game show"</em> &raquo; You’re watching Family Fortunes on Challenge. It’s been on for 22 minutes.</li>
            <li><em>"Switch over to BBC 1"</em> &raquo; Now tuned to EastEnders on BBC 1. It kicked off 14 minutes ago.</li>

          <h3>Inventions</h3>
          <p>I like inventing things and sometimes they are novel enough to be
             patentable. Most of the things I invent belong to my employer, so
             can't be shared here. However I do have <strong>13</strong> filed
             or issued patents in the public domain. Below are a <em>selection</em>
             of these:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://patents.justia.com/patent/9232267">Constructing a broadcast multiplex</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://patents.justia.com/patent/8913879">Simultaneous recording programs on a DVR</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://patents.justia.com/patent/20150379330">Entropy-reducing filter for face-detection</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://patents.justia.com/patent/20150256869">Abstract time domain scheduling</a></li>
