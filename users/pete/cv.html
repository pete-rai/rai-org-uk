        <div class="overview">
          <p>
            I'm a software engineer by training, experience and desire. I've been
            "hands dirty" on everything from embedded to cloud. I've led high
            stakes projects and large international teams - working to impossible
            requirements and improbable deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I am working on projects that help push the limits of what
            is possible - in order to forge new markets and create new
            opportunities.

        <h2>Cisco <span class="role">Principal Engineer</span></h2>
        <p>
          I work in the Emerging Technologies and Incubation group at Cisco. I am
          part of a team who are tasked with exploring new areas that are opened
          up by advances in technology. Although the potential opportunities are
          huge, most often the requirements are still ambiguous, technology is
          still nascent and revenue chains unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role is to take these early market opportunities and explore them
          in concrete terms - by leading development teams and working in
          concert with domain experts. We donâ€™t do PowerPoint - we tackle the
          problems head-on by building tangible, working, hype-busting systems.
          I lead by example, spending much of my time writing cloud native
          applications and coding across the development stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of my role, I am expected to perform technical evaluation on
          a range of platforms and companies and to present complex technical
          choices in simple to understand ways to key decision makers, inside
          and outside of the company. I have authored more than
          <a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/pete-rai">two dozen patents</a>,
          with more on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a technical advisor to our Government Affairs group and
          represent Cisco on several forums on topics such as the ethics of AI,
          data trusts, university liaison, research grant approval, etc. I am a
          member of <a href="https://www.techuk.org/">techUK</a>'s Data
          Analytics & AI Leadership Committee.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work closely with our Social Responsibility group and am the lead
          for Cisco's mentoring programme for underachieving children. I also
          founded Cisco's <a href="https://gblogs.cisco.com/uki/building-diverse-talent-for-an-ethical-future-of-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence/">
          Machine Learning for Young Women</a> programme.
        </p>
        <p>
          At work, I am currently building a comprehensive, policy-driven, data
          brokering platform. At home, I am <a href="http://pete.rai.org.uk/">tinkering
          about</a> on a bunch of fun stuff.

          I worked in engineering and leadership roles on all aspects of the
          software stack from highly performant and available server-side
          components to content delivery infrastructure to consumer facing
          websites and set-top-box programme guides.
